# Web Components Project
The **Web components project** is a collection of elements made with HTML, CSS and JS.  Each of them is coded with pure languages, based on a previous design.

Here, I collected some of my components that I made while I designed web pages for projects. Some types of saved items are:

 - Navigation bars
 - Tables
